# Student Wonder Coach
## A small website project for a student consultancy
With universities taking on an increasing number of new students each year, professors are finding less time to support students individually in their thesis preparation and process. Student Wonder Coach enters the scene, offering counsel and support.

## The Design
Based on the brand taking on a superhero narrative, I developed a visual language with strong colours, playful imagery and a recognizable logo, telling a story of guidance and ease. Student Wonder Coach will step in to help, and make things that seemed impossible effortless.

## The Stack
The website offers information about the student coach services, first answers to common questions as well as a contact form for interested parties. 

It is based on HTML, CSS and Javascript. Libraries used in development are vue.js, smoothscroll.js and the Intersection Observer API.
